Dr. Patterson utilized a\ngoniometer to measure the current active Range of Motion (ROM). Results indicated significant\nlimitations: Right Rotation was 45 degrees (Normal: 80), Left Rotation was 42 degrees (Normal: 80),\nFlexion was 35 degrees (Normal: 50), and Extension was 40 degrees (Normal: 60).
